# Development Plan — V2 (From Service → Product Signal)

## Context
V1 is live and doing its job:
- clear positioning
- credible authority
- low-noise conversion
- paid, scoped offer

V2 is **not** about more pages or more polish.

V2 is about:
- shifting perception from *“solo service”* → *“productised judgement”*
- validating demand for software
- laying foundations for a scalable product without committing too early

---

## V2 Core Goal
**Turn the site from “book me” into “this is becoming a product”.**

You still sell reviews.
But visitors should start thinking:
> “This feels like the front door to something bigger.”

---

## V2 Non-Goals
- no full SaaS UI
- no accounts
- no dashboards
- no aggressive lead capture
- no content treadmill

We are still staying calm, senior, and boring.

---

## Strategic Shift (V1 → V2)
### V1 framing
> “I do architecture reviews.”

### V2 framing
> **“I run structured assessments for risky system decisions.”**

Same work.
Different *shape*.

This is crucial for scale.

---

## Information Architecture (V2)
Add **one** major concept page and evolve language.

### Pages
- `/` Home (refined language)
- `/assessments` **NEW** (key V2 page)
- `/assessments/architecture-review` (existing offer, reframed)
- `/assessments/white-labelling-readiness` (new wedge page)
- `/writing` (unchanged, optional)
- `/contact` or booking link
- `/privacy`

Navigation:
- Assessments
- Writing
- Contact

---

## New Page: `/assessments` (critical)
This is the **product bridge**.

### Purpose
Explain that what you offer is:
- repeatable
- structured
- assessment-based
- not ad-hoc consulting

### Content outline
#### Hero
**“Decision-focused system assessments.”**

Subhead:
> Structured reviews for teams about to make high-risk technical changes.

#### What an assessment is
- scoped
- time-boxed
- produces artefacts
- answers a decision

Explicitly contrast with:
- open-ended consulting
- delivery work
- staff augmentation

#### Assessment types (initial)
- Architecture Review (current)
- White-Labelling Readiness
- Migration Readiness (coming soon)
- Scaling / Load Readiness (coming soon)

“Coming soon” is intentional — it signals roadmap.

#### How assessments work
1. Capture system reality
2. Surface risk patterns
3. Force sequencing
4. Produce a decision artefact

This mirrors the future software flow.

---

## Reframe the Existing Offer (important)
### Rename subtly
Instead of:
> Architecture Review

Use:
> **Architecture Readiness Assessment**

Language matters.

### Update copy to emphasise:
- structure
- repeatability
- decision outcome
- artefacts

Not:
- your time
- your experience
- your opinion

---

## New Page: White-Labelling Readiness
This becomes your **product wedge**.

### Purpose
- attract people with a specific, painful problem
- validate demand for decision software
- become the canonical reference for this problem

### Content focus
- why white-labelling is risky
- what teams underestimate
- what decisions matter early
- what a “ready” system looks like

CTA:
- “Request a white-labelling assessment”
- or “Join early access for the readiness tool”

This is your first explicit **software hint**.

---

## Introduce “Artefacts” Language
Throughout the site, consistently mention outputs:

- readiness report
- risk register
- sequencing plan
- assumptions & unknowns log

This does two things:
1. Increases perceived value
2. Makes the eventual software feel inevitable

---

## V2 Conversion Strategy
Primary CTA:
- **Request an assessment**

Secondary CTA (new):
- **Join early access** (email capture, very soft)

The second CTA is *not* aggressive.
It’s a signal:
> “This is becoming something.”

---

## V2 Writing Strategy (minimal but strategic)
Add **1–2 posts only**, tightly aligned with product direction.

Recommended:
- “White-labelling isn’t branding. It’s architecture.”
- “The decision most teams make too late.”

Each post should:
- reference assessments
- reference readiness
- subtly imply systemisation

No cadence. No pressure.

---

## Technical Changes (lightweight)
### Site
- Add `/assessments` route
- Adjust copy language globally (review → assessment)
- Add “coming soon” assessment cards

### Forms
- Split enquiries:
  - assessment request
  - early access interest

Store both the same way initially.

---

## V2 Acceptance Criteria
V2 is successful if:
- visitors understand this is structured, not bespoke
- “assessment” language feels natural everywhere
- white-labelling page attracts specific enquiries
- people ask: *“Is this a tool?”* (this is a win)
- early access emails start trickling in

---

## What We Are Deliberately Delaying
- product UI
- pricing pages for software
- onboarding flows
- tech stack decisions
- SaaS branding

Those come **after** demand clarity.

---

## V2 → V3 Preview (so you know where this goes)
If V2 works, V3 becomes:
- interactive assessment prototype
- gated questionnaire
- auto-generated sample report
- paid pilot customers

But **only** once V2 language resonates.

---

## Immediate Next Actions
1. Add `/assessments` page
2. Reframe architecture review language
3. Create white-labelling readiness page
4. Add soft “early access” CTA
5. Update homepage copy to emphasise *assessments*

---

## Final Guiding Principle
You are not “adding features”.

You are:
> **slowly revealing that your judgement can be productised.**

That’s how you build something that can scale to seven figures without breaking what already works.
